# dwd-trajectory

Given a tree of grib files from the DWD Opendata server, read the relevant
parameters and compute a wind trajectory at a given location, time and altude.

The code is largely based on  https://github.com/fvalka/nwp-sounding and
 https://github.com/fvalka/icon-skewt-plot - thanks!


Step 1: read grib files. Example output in stiwoll.txt .
